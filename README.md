- 👋 Hi, I’m @StanKrajci108, call me simply Stan. 
- 👀 I’m interested in creating modern applications and websites that make you feel - "I will stay here still a few minutes at least" :))
- 🌱 I’m currently learning REACT, and new tools for CSS to be more efficient in realizing my visions
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on applications where I can show you my UX/UI passion. I'm in the Junior stage of my development, but frankly, you have all been there, and each opportunity to show up is priceless.
- 📫 You can reach me via email: krajci.s@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: goal-oriented, systematic, observant, diligent, enthusiastic, and I get things done with fun
- ⚡ Fun fact: I don't know if it's funny, but I NEVER give up
